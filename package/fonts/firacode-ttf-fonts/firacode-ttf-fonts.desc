[I] Free monospaced font with programming ligatures

[T] Fira Code is a free monospaced font containing ligatures for common
[T] programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering
[T] feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read
[T] and understand code faster.
