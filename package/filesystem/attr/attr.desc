[I] Extended Attributes Of Filesystem Objects

[T] Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated perma-
[T] nently with files and directories, similar to the environ-
[T] ment strings associated with a process. An attribute may
[T] be defined or undefined. If it is defined, its value may
[T] be empty or non-empty.

[T] Extended attributes are extensions to the normal
[T] attributes which are associated with all inodes in the
[T] system (i.e. the stat(2) data). They are often used to
[T] provide additional functionality to a filesystem - for
[T] example, additional security features such as Access Con-
[T] trol Lists (ACLs) may be implemented using extended
[T] attributes.
