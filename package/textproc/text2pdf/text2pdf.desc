[I] A text file to PDF converter

[T] As you might be able to guess from the name, text2pdf converts text
[T] files to PDF. You can specify the font, number of lines and columns,
[T] paper size and various other options from the command line. By default,
[T] long lines will be wrapped, and a formfeed character (^L) will cause a
[T] page break. I've dumped the result of text2pdf -h in case you want to
[T] see all the options now.
[T]
[T] The program is actually very simple to use. All you normally do is
[T] text2pdf myfile > myfile.pdf.
