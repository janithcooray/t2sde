[I] A Perl GUI toolkit

[T] Prima is an extensible Perl toolkit for multi-platform GUI
[T] development. Supported platforms include Linux, Windows NT/9x/2K, OS/2,
[T] and UNIX/X11 workstations (FreeBSD, IRIX, SunOS, Solaris, and others). The
[T] toolkit contains a rich set of standard widgets and has emphasis on 2D
[T] image processing tasks. A Perl program using Prima looks and behaves
[T] identically on X, Win32, and OS/2 PM.
