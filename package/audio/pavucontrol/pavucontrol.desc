[I] PulseAudio Volume Control

[T] PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume
[T] control tool ("mixer") for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to
[T] classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of
[T] hardware devices and of each playback stream separately.
