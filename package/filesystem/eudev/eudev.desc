[I] Init system agnostic fork of systemd-udev

[T] Eudev is a standalone dynamic and persistent device naming support
[T] (aka userspace devfs) daemon that runs independently from the init
[T] system. eudev strives to remain init system and linux distribution
[T] neutral. It is currently used as the devfs manager for more than a
[T] dozen different linux distributions.
