[I] An oldschool sample-based music composition tool

[T] Schism Tracker is a free and open-source reimplementation of Impulse
[T] Tracker, a program used to create high quality music without the
[T] requirements of specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique
[T] "finger feel" that is difficult to replicate in part. The player is based
[T] on a highly modified version of the Modplug engine, with a number of
[T] bugfixes and changes to improve IT playback.
