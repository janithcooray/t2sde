[T] GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which provides
[T] a secure layer, over a reliable transport layer. Currently the
[T] GnuTLS library implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS
[T] working group.
[T]
[T] Quoting from RFC2246 - the TLS 1.0 protocol specification:
[T] "The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet.
[T] The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that
[T] is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery."
