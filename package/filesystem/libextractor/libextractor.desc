[I] A meta-data extraction library

[T] Libextractor is a library used to extract meta-data from files of
[T] arbitrary type. It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform the
[T] actual extraction, and to be trivially extendable by linking against
[T] external extractors for additional file types. The goal is to provide
[T] developers of file-sharing networks, file managers, and WWW-indexing bots
[T] with a universal library to obtain meta-data about files. It includes
[T] a shell-command and bindings for Java (JNI) and Python.
