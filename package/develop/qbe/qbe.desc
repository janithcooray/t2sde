[I] A simple C compiler backend

[T] QBE aims to be a pure C embeddable backend that provides 70% of the
[T] performance of advanced compilers in 10% of the code. Its small size
[T] serves both its aspirations of correctness and our ability to understand,
[T] fix, and improve it. It also serves its users by providing trivial
[T] integration and great flexibility.
