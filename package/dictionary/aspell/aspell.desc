[I] A More Intelligent Ispell

[T] Aspell is an Open Source spell checker designed to eventually replace
[T] Ispell. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming
[T] up with possible suggestions than Ispell does. In fact recent tests
[T] shows that it even does better than Microsoft Word 97's spell checker
[T] or just about any other spell checker I have seen. It also has support
[T] for checking (La)TeX and Html files, and run time support for other non
[T] English languages. Aspell also is a library however the recommend way
[T] to use aspell is through the Pspell library as the actual interface to
[T] the aspell library is constantly changing.
