[I] Common Unix Printing System

[T] CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based operating
[T] systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products to provide
[T] a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS
[T] provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.
[T]
[T] CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
[T] for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
[T] RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are
[T] also supported with reduced functionality. CUPS adds network printer
[T] browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based printing
[T] options to support real world applications under UNIX.
[T]
[T] CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently
[T] based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be
[T] used to support non-PostScript printers.
