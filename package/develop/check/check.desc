[I] A unit testing framework for C

[T] Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple
[T] interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
[T] developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
[T] catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
[T] faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
[T] source code editors and IDEs.
