[I] Emulator for the Oberon RISC machine

[T] This is an emulator for the Oberon RISC machine.
[T]
[T] Project Oberon is a design for a complete desktop computer system from
[T] scratch. Its simplicity and clarity enables a single person to know and
[T] implement the whole system, while still providing enough power to make it
[T] useful and usable in a production environment.
