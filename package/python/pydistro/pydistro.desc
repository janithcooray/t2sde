[I] Linux OS platform information API

[T] Distro provides information about the OS distribution it runs on,
[T] such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version information.
[T] It is the recommended replacement for Python's original
[T] platform.linux_distribution function (removed in Python 3.8).
[T] It also provides much more functionality which isn't necessarily
[T] Python bound, like a command-line interface.
