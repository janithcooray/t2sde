[I] IPMI Management Utilities

[T] The IPMI Management Utilities (ipmiutil, formerly known as panicsel)
[T] project provides a series of utilities that perform common IPMI server
[T] management functions, such as viewing the firmware log (showsel), or
[T] configuring the BMC LAN & PEF features (pefconfig). The utilities are
[T] designed for end-users, so that they should not require intimate
[T] knowledge of how to build IPMI commands.
