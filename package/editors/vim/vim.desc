[I] VI Improved

[T] Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi. Many new
[T] features have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting,
[T] command line history, on-line help, filename completion, block
[T] operations, etc. There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
[T] available. See doc/vi_diff.txt.
[T]
[T] This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII
[T] files. All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so
[T] those who can type with ten fingers can work very fast. Additionally,
[T] function keys can be defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
[T]
[T] Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari
[T] MiNT, Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of
[T] UNIX. Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.
[T]
[T] This T2 package optinally contains two binaries: vim - which is not linked
[T] against any X11 library (an so suited for server use), and gvim - the
[T] Gtk+ version (which needs X11 and Gtk+ to be executed ...).
