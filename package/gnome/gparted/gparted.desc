[T] GParted is the Gnome Partition Editor application.
[T] GParted is an industrial-strength package for creating, destroying,
[T] resizing, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them.
[T] This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing
[T] disk usage, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition
[T] with another (disk imaging).
