[I] Fast MPEG requantiser for Linux

[T] Vamps evaporates DVD compliant MPEG2 program streams by selectively copying
[T] audio and subpicture tracks and by re-quantizing the embedded elementary video
[T] stream. A shrink factor may be either specified for the video ES (elementary
[T] stream) only or for the full PS.
