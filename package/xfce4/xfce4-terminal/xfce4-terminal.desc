[I] Modern terminal emulator primarly for Xfce

[T] Terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Unix/Linux desktop
[T] - primarly for the Xfce desktop environment. We developed it because
[T] we saw the need for a lightweight and easy to use terminal emulator
[T] in the Xfce desktop environment, that doesn't require the user to
[T] install the GNOME plattform, but still provides a worthy alternative
[T] to the GNOME terminal emulator.
