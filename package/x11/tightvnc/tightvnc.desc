[I] An enhanced VNC distribution

[T] TightVNC is a VNC distribution with many new features, improvements,
[T] and bugfixes over VNC. It is optimized for faster operation on slow
[T] network links such as modem connections, provides more configuration
[T] options in the server, features automatic SSH tunneling in the Unix
[T] vncviewer, and more. The modified servers and viewers are fully
[T] compatible with the original VNC software.
