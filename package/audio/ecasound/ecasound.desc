[I] Sound processing, multitrack recording, and mixing tools

[T] Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
[T] processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback,
[T] recording, and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect
[T] processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. It supports a wide
[T] range of audio inputs, outputs, and effect algorithms. Effects and
[T] audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their parameters
[T] can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs. A
[T] versatile console-mode user interface is included in the package.
