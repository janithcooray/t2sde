[I] Alternative to locate, faster and compatible with mlocate's database

[T] plocate is a locate(1) based on posting lists, completely replacing
[T] mlocate with a much faster (and smaller) index. It is suitable as a
[T] default locate on your system.
[T] It does nearly all I/O asynchronously using io_uring if available,
[T] which reduces the impact of seek latency on systems without SSDs.
