[I] The GL Vendor-Neutral Dispatch library

[T] libglvnd is a vendor-neutral dispatch layer for arbitrating OpenGL API
[T] calls between multiple vendors. It allows multiple drivers from different
[T] vendors to coexist on the same filesystem, and determines which vendor to
[T] dispatch each API call to at runtime.
[T]
[T] Both GLX and EGL are supported, in any combination with OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
