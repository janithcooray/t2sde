[I] A free portable runtime library

[T] The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create
[T] and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and
[T] consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations.
[T] The primary goal is to provide an API to which software developers
[T] may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behaviour
[T] regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving
[T] them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or
[T] take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.
