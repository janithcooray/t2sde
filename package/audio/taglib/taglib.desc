[I] Audio Meta-Data Library

[T] TagLib is a library for reading and editing the meta-data of several
[T] popular audio formats. Currently it supports both ID3v1 and ID3v2 for
[T] MP3 files, Ogg Vorbis comments and ID3 tags and Vorbis comments in
[T] FLAC files.
[T]
[T] It is written in modern C++, very fast (about 6 times faster than
[T] id3lib and 3 times faster than libvorbisfile at reading tags) and does
[T] not have any external dependency.
