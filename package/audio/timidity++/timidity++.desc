[T] TiMidity++ can play MIDI files by converting them into PCM waveform
[T] data; give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument data files, then it
[T] synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play sounds, but
[T] also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks as various audio file
[T] formats.
