[I] Portable Computing Language

[T] Portable Computing Language (pocl) aims to become a MIT-licensed
[T] open source implementation of the OpenCL standard which can be easily
[T] adapted for new targets and devices, both for homogeneous CPU and
[T] heterogenous GPUs/accelerators.
[T]
[T] pocl uses Clang as an OpenCL C frontend and LLVM for the kernel
[T] compiler implementation, and as a portability layer. Thus, if your
[T] desired target has an LLVM backend, it should be able to get OpenCL
[T] support easily by using pocl.
