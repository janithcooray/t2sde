[I] Asynchronous I/O library

[T] AIO enables even a single application thread to overlap I/O operations
[T] with other processing, by providing an interface for submitting one or
[T] more I/O requests in one system call (io_submit()) without waiting for
[T] completion, and a separate interface (io_getevents()) to reap completed
[T] I/O operations associated with a given completion group.
