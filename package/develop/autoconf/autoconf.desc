[I] A GNU tool for automatically configuring source code

[T] Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
[T] scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
[T] These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
[T] systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates a
[T] configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
[T] operating system features that the package can use, in the form of m4
[T] macro calls.
