[I] Electronic mail transport agent

[T] Sendmail implements a general purpose internetwork mail routing facility
[T] under the UNIX(R) operating system. It is not tied to any one transport
[T] protocol its function may be likened to a crossbar switch, relaying
[T] messages from one domain into another. In the process, it can do a limited
[T] amount of message header editing to put the message into a format that is
[T] appropriate for the receiving domain. All of this is done under the
[T] control of a configuration file. ...Due to the requirements of flexibility
[T] for the configuration file can seem somewhat unapproachable. However,
[T] there are only a few basic configurations for most sites, for which
[T] standard configuration files have been supplied. Most other configurations
[T] can be built by adjusting an existing configuration file incrementally.
[T]
[T] Read /etc/mail/README or the O'Reilly book for details on configuring
[T] sendmail.
