[I] A general XWindow keygrabber (ment for blackbox)

[T] is the keygrabber for the blackbox window manager. bbkeys
[T] handles all keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for blackbox. It uses
[T] blackbox's Image classes for rendering its look and feel so that
[T] will render itself to match whatever blackbox style is used. It is highly
[T] configurable either via the bbconf GUI utility or the (now deprecated)
[T] bbkeysconf GUI utility or by hand-editting bbkeys's config file
