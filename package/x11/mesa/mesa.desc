[I] 3-D graphics library with OpenGL API

[T] Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that
[T] of OpenGL*. To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax
[T] or state machine, it is being used with authorization from Silicon Graphics,
[T] Inc. However, the author makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a
[T] compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with Silicon Graphics, Inc.
[T] Those who want a licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed
[T] vendor.
[T]
[T] While Mesa is not a licensed OpenGL implementation, it is currently
[T] being tested with the OpenGL conformance tests. For the current
[T] conformance status see the CONFORM file included in the Mesa distribution.
