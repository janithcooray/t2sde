[I] A generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm

[T] Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses
[T] data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm,
[T] Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
[T] comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression
[T] methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense
[T] compression.
